# Operating-Systems-Lesson-Projects

This repository contains two school projects:

1-) Shell Project: a simple terminal application. Main terminal program is accountant. 
When we start the accountant on terminal, procces wait from us commands.

with insert command we insert a digit numbers to database.txt. 

calculate -s number number -> it collects 2 data from represented index.
calculate -r number number -> it collects data between two index.

clear -> it clears your terminal.

(it can't collects last index, a little bug ðŸ˜€)


2-) Thread Project: This project is about Thread Synchronization

when we start main program from terminal, it forkes inside to another program which is name's reader.
reader process collects datas from data.txt and sends it to main program and continue to work until it reaches a negative value
